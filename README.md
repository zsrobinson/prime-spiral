# Prime Spiral

This mini-project was based on the [3Blue1Brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EK32jo7i5LQ) about the phenomenon where the graphing of prime numbers using the polar coordinate system can yield some interesting results. I just wanted to see if I could quickly code up a similar demonstration as he showed in the video.

This project relies on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I'm using an isPrime function from a [comment on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40200710/15938350) and the p5.js type declarations from a [comment on GitHub](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/1339#issuecomment-354351574).

As I mentioned, this project is mostly a proof-of-concept, so I didn't set up a project like I would for a website I was really going to pour a ton of time into. This means that I used CDNs for the project's dependencies and just added the type declarations as files in the codebase. Doing so allowed me to avoid dealing with any sort of build step or npm.
